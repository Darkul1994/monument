{"name":"monumentjs","tagline":"super simple event based routing for nodejs. The high cohesion, low coupling framework.","body":"# monumentjs\r\nmonumentjs doesn't just facilitate dealing with events, it fully embraces an event driven programming model. It does everything through events. Everything.\r\n\r\nData is passed through events, routes are handled through events, and things are logged through events.\r\n\r\n## Some features:\r\n- resource pooling - This is not connection pooling, this is resource pooling, where a thousand pages asking for the same data from the database at the same time result in one request to the database instead of a thousand. Or ten thousand. If a request comes in requesting the same data before the database responds it simple waits until the data comes back from the DB like whoever initiated the call to the DB to begin with.\r\n- isomorphic routing - The routing is completely event based, this means that a route document (JSON) can be shared between the server side code and the front end code, allowing true isomorphic routing. Handlers can be shared as well... but since they likely are a little different in their needs that might not be as common as we would like.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
