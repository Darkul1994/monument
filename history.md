  - revised to match the new paradigm
  - revised the route and connection modules to match the line of reasoning in #38. More functional, a little cleaner and a diversion from the standard model of other node app frameworks that modify the incoming request. Now we don't. They are added to the connection object that wraps the request and response objects. This changes how you work with the request.
